  <h2>Bio:</h2>
  <h4>Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper and music producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as among the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists.</h4>
